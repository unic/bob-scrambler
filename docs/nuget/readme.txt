Scrambler
=========

** Post Installation Steps **
1. Move the provided config file "Unic.Bob.Scrambler.config" (App_Config\Include) to
the correct folder in your project. It should only be used for local environments,
which most probably means you have to move it into a "xx_local" folder.

2. Read the documentation in Bob - The Book [https://teamcity.unic.com/repository/download/Sitecore_Frameworks_Bob_TheBook_BuildTheBook/.lastSuccessful/Scrambler/README.html].
